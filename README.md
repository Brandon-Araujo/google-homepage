Goals and process:

This is my first project using HTML and CSS. I will be reproducing the Google homepage in order to practice what I have learned about HTML and CSS. 

Learning Outcomes:

The project has given me a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS. It has helped solidify what I have learned up to this point and I feel more confident using the two languages. I feel that I have a firmer grasp on CSS layout, particularly in the use of flexbox. It has been interesting to see how HTML and CSS work together and how versatile they are.
